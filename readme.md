## 🌀 Overview

**Harmoniius** is an AI-powered resonance tracking system that helps users identify hidden sources of emotional, physiological, and environmental disharmony—then guides them gently back into balance. It uses wearable data, geolocation, and time-based patterns to surface stress triggers, “return points,” and unresolved energetic loops.

Over time, Harmoniius evolves into a **planetary resonance map**, highlighting both global stress zones and healing locations through collective, anonymized insight.

This repository serves as the **original declaration and public time-stamped authorship of Harmoniius.**

## 🧭 Core Features

### ✅ 7-Day Free Insight Loop
- App passively collects stress, HRV, sleep, and location data
- After 7 days, generates a personalized **Harmony Report**:
  - Frequent stress zones
  - Resonant “Return Points”
  - Time-of-day disharmony patterns
- Tapping deeper prompts a soft paywall:
  > *“Unlock full resonance mapping and guided insights – $7.99/month”*

---

### 🧠 Personal Harmony Engine
- HRV, stress, and location tracking
- Disharmony loop detection (times, places, rhythms)
- AI pattern detection & feedback
- Gentle notifications + personalized recommendations

---

### 🌍 Planetary Resonance Mapping
- Opt-in, anonymized collective data layer
- Global map of:
  - Urban stress vortexes
  - Nature-based “return points”
  - Joy spikes (high-resonance clusters)

---

### 🔗 Resonance Link (Optional)
- Users who approve each other can form encrypted “loopback pairs”
- Subtle support nudges and synced breathing sessions
- Detect overlapping disharmony events + suggest co-regulation

---

## 🔮 Future Features

- **Joy Mapping**: Where the body remembers calm  
- **Group Mode**: Workplace or community-level feedback  
- **Harmoniius SDK**: Allow other apps/devices to plug into the resonance grid  
- **NutriSync (sister app)**: Supplement recommendations based on disharmony telemetry

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack (Planned MVP)

- **Frontend**: React (Vite or Next.js), Mantine UI  
- **Backend**: Node.js / Express  
- **Database**: MongoDB  
- **Wearable Integration**: Apple HealthKit, Google Fit, Garmin, Oura  
- **AI**: OpenAI + custom rule engine  
- **Geolocation Layer**: Mapbox or Leaflet  
- **Payments**: Stripe Subscriptions

## 💡 Vision

> Harmoniius helps people:  
> - Understand their own repeating stress patterns  
> - Recognize where and when they return to balance  
> - Harmonize relationships through silent awareness  
> - Co-create a living map of Earth’s energetic landscape

This `README.md` and its GitHub commit act as **the timestamped origin artifact** of the Harmoniius concept, design, and future expansion.
